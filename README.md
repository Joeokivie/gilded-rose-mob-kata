# gilded-rose-mob-kata

We used the following tools to enable face-to-face-like remote mob programming:

Tools:
Visual Studio Code Live Share

Real-time collaborative editing and debugging

Enables seamless pair and mob programming

Discord

Used for persistent voice channels and screen sharing during mob sessions

Offers fast, low-latency audio communication with the ability to share code snippets and media in chat

Microsoft Teams

Used for scheduling, backup communication, and storing shared documents

Enabled structured collaboration and file sharing among our mob members




 Rationale:
VS Code Live Share enables real-time coding collaboration without the need for screen sharing.

Discord provides low-latency, always-on voice channels for smooth discussion and coordination.

Microsoft Teams supports our project with scheduled meetings, shared files, and notes, helping us stay organized.
